To verify the algorithm I have to provide a small example. Refer the below link for a 480p nv12 tiled video.

If you use the above video to test the code, once you done with the conversion use a yuv player to verify the output. I have used vooya player. See example_screen_shot.png for more details.

NOTE : A tiled formated yuv video of 720p and 1080p is too large to upload and distribute. I am working on a reverse algorithm to convert nv12 to nv12 tiled format. But to the best of my knowledge (due to rigorous testing) all resolutions are working with this algorithm including both landscape and portrait mode videos, still check at your end as well.
